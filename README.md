# My Mad Lib

#### _Another Mad Lib, 3/24/2021_

#### By _**Patrick Lee, Brandon Magofna and Tiffany Greathead**_

## Description

This mad lib was created as a group project at Epicodus. We created a short mad lib story of our own and made a website with a form layout for user input. A user can input a word of their choosing that fits the parts of speech the label asks for. When the form is completed and the "Show me the story" button is clicked, or when the user presses enter, the form is submitted and the mad lib story is displayed. The form adds the text the user typed in the form to complete a short and entertaining story.
